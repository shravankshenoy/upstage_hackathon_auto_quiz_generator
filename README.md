- **Quiz generation Pipeline**: extracts the text from webpage or pdf and passes it to Llama 3 to generate a quiz in JSON format.
- **Quiz evaluation Pipeline**: evaluates the quiz generated by the quiz generation pipeline. Uses RAG with Solar Embeddings and Chroma retriever to get relevant context for the given question. UpstageChat uses this context to answer the question. If answers of Llama 3 and UpstageChat match, question is retained, if answers do not match, question is discarded
